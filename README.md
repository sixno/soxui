I've used some front-end libraries in depth, and I've relied heavily on them, even though I work more with the server side.





Among the front-end libraries I've used most, jQuery is not strictly a front-end library, it's a Js toolkit for easy manipulation of HTML Dom.





After jQuery, one of my favorite front-end libraries is called layui, which is great for people who work mainly on the server side, and because it's more like an extension and extension of jQuery itself, I'm more receptive to it.





A few years ago, with the popularity of APP development, so-called mobile front-end frameworks became popular, and among the many libraries with different features, I preferred Frame Work 7. Before that, there was something called the App Framework, the predecessor of jqmobi, which had nothing to do with jQuery, most of all with the idea of Dom manipulation, and then slowly declined after it was acquired by Intel. It's really convenient to build an H5 APP with Frame Work 7, and the framework also provides native style support for mobile platforms, but as far as the current situation of H5 applications is concerned, it is still subject to more constraints. For ease of use, it is worse than layui.




Apart from jQuery, the libraries mentioned above, although relatively easy to use, still have their own unique drawbacks, although all these libraries can also be introduced after cross-using their own excellent features, but inevitably make the project code bloated. So the initial goal of this soxui library is to copy and rewrite features from other excellent libraries so that those excellent features coexist in a project with minimal code as useful additions to the primary library, and at the same time, soxui is committed to building its own complete framework ecology.

# SOXUI

我深入地使用过一些前端库，曾深深地依赖过它们，即使我本身地工作更多地是和服务端打交道。

在我使用过地前端库中，jQuery是我使用最多的一个工具，严格意义上来说，它并不能算作前端库，它是一个Js工具包，用于方便地操作HTML Dom。

在jQuery之后，我所喜欢地一个前端库叫做layui，这个库对于主要从事服务端工作地人来说非常棒，由于它本身更像是jQuery的延伸和拓展，所以我对它的接受度比较高。

几年前随着APP开发的流行，所谓的移动前端框架也渐渐流行起来，在众多各有特点的库中，我更倾向于使用Frame Work 7。在此之前有一款叫做App Framework的东西，前身是jqmobi（虽然叫jq但和jQuery其实没有什么关系，最多是操作Dom方面的思路借鉴），被Intel收购之后就慢慢没落了。用Frame Work 7来构建一个H5的APP确实比较方便，而且这个框架还提供了移动平台的本土化样式支持，但就H5应用的现状来看，本身依然受到了比较多的制约。易用性上来说，比layui要差一些。

除了jQuery外，上面提到的几个库虽然都比较好用，但依旧有着它们各自独有的弊端，虽然也可以把这些库全部引入后交叉使用各自优秀的特性，但难免会使项目的代码变得臃肿不堪。所以，这个soxui库初期的目标是仿制、改写其他优秀的库中的特性，使那些优秀的特性以最少的代码共存于一个项目中，作为主要使用库的有益增补，同时，soxui也会致力于构建自身完整的框架生态。
